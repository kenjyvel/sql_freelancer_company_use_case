There are three tabs in this document that each contain a table description with a few rows of sample data that you can use for reference.  
A 'filled job post' is defined as a post that has hired a freelancer
We can assume that only one freelancer can be hired per job

### Question to answer
* For freelancers whose 'category with highest 2019 earnings' was "Writing" (note: freelancers can earn in multiple categories), what was their (freelancer-level) average monthly earnings across all categories for 2019 (limited to months when they worked)?
* How many freelancers were hired in at least 2 categories within 1 month of registration, for registrations that occured in 2019?
* What is the share of of total job posts in 2019 that were 'filled within 7 days of job post and by a freelancer registered in the US'?
